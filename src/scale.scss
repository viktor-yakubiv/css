/*!
 * Scale
 *
 * Global scale for (font) sizing and spacing.
 *
 * Size scale is designed to use for scaling text and icons.
 * Space scale is designed to use for scaling margin, padding,
 * gap (grid and flexbox gap) or any other non-textual whitespace.
 *
 * 400 is assumed to be default, similar to the normal font weight for text.
 * The scale was designed based on this assumption, starting from 400
 * and increasing it for the higher numbers, and decreasing for the lower ones.
 *
 * The naming convention intentionally presumes possibility
 * to create intermediate options like `--size-450: 1.125rem;`
 * but those are recommended be avoided unless necessary.
